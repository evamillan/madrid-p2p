# madrid-p2p
A simple web application that shows a map of Madrid and a widget with information about the neighbourhoods with most of the P2P apartments.
The widget reacts to map movement, updating the data when the user moves the map.


The app uses the [CARTO.js library](https://carto.com/developers/carto-js/) and the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial).
I altered the map, removing some elements and changing some colors, in order to avoid distractions and to make the relevant information pop up more.
I tried to keep the project structure as simple as possible, with just one file each for the HTML, CSS and JavaScript so no bundlers are required.

The app can be seen live at https://evamillan.github.io/madrid-p2p. You can also download this repository and access the index.html file.
